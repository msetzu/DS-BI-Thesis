La seconda cosa che vorrei dire in premessa \\u00e8 che abbiamo letto le agenzie, perch\\u00e9 noi non facciamo parte della maggioranza, e sappiamo dei tentativi messi in campo questa mattina per cercare di tenere insieme la maggioranza non sulla fiducia, senza votare la fiducia, ma votando gli emendamenti in modo tale da poter proseguire nell'azione di Governo, secondo un ragionamento talmente bizantino che nessuno \\u00e8 riuscito a capirlo. Lo voglio ricordare perch\\u00e9 quando qualcuno di voi, qualcuno dei giornali o delle televisioni, o qualche intellettuale da strapazzo ci verr\\u00e0 a dire che questo \\u00e8 il Governo della seriet\\u00e0, noi gli ricorderemo le scene da basso impero di questa mattina.  Noi abbiamo di fronte sfide terribili ed epocali, cui in parte hanno gi\\u00e0 fatto cenno i colleghi del Gruppo che sono intervenuti. Ricorder\\u00f2 soltanto un dato che \\u00e8 stato rilasciato con l'ultimo bollettino dell'Autorit\\u00e0 per l'energia: nell'ultimo anno il prezzo medio della bolletta del gas per le famiglie italiane \\u00e8 salito del 70,7 per cento; la bolletta dell'elettricit\\u00e0 da adesso a luglio 2023 salir\\u00e0 del 91,4 per cento. Anch'io sono costretto a fare il quadro geopolitico - oserei dire - della situazione in cui siamo tutti noi coinvolti: c'\\u00e8 la guerra a 700 chilometri dal confine italiano, c'\\u00e8 una difficolt\\u00e0 enorme a garantire l'approvvigionamento del gas, c'\\u00e8 un problema enorme a far uscire il grano sul Mar Nero, c'\\u00e8 il rischio della carestia nei Paesi africani, c'\\u00e8 il rischio concretissimo che la carestia generi nuove ondate migratorie che si aggiungono a quelle gi\\u00e0 esistenti, c'\\u00e8 il problema dell'inflazione mai cos\\u00ec alta dal 1986, c'\\u00e8 una pandemia che non sappiamo ancora se sia alle nostre spalle, c'\\u00e8 una crisi di siccit\\u00e0 che mette in ginocchio l'agricoltura. Queste sono tutte le emergenze di cui gli italiani si preoccupano e che gli italiani credono dovrebbero essere al centro dell'azione del Governo. Ci vorrebbe, per\\u00f2, un Governo forte, coeso e serio, invece noi da settimane - ho perso il conto di quante - viviamo in una bolla fatta di ricatti, di teatrini, di ultimatum e penultimatum, tutte cose che appartengono alla peggiore prima Repubblica. Abbiamo un ex Presidente del Consiglio, Conte, che deve ancora elaborare il duplice lutto derivante dalla scissione di Di Maio e dal suo sfratto da Palazzo Chigi e che un giorno s\\u00ec e l'altro pure bombarda il Governo. Il Presidente del Consiglio italiano \\u00e8 in missione a Kiev, in zona di guerra, e mentre \\u00e8 a Kiev non sa se il suo Paese ha una politica estera, perch\\u00e9 negli stessi giorni in Italia la sua maggioranza di politiche estere ne mette in campo tre o addirittura quattro. E poi, pochi giorni dopo, a Madrid, abbiamo una riunione storica della NATO per decidere l'ingresso di Svezia e di Finlandia, ma il nostro Presidente del Consiglio, sempre Draghi, deve ritornare precipitosamente in Italia: \\u00e8 una bellissima figura che il nostro Paese fa sullo scenario internazionale! Voi ci dite che il Governo \\u00e8 quello che garantisce l'immagine dell'Italia all'estero. Ebbene, Draghi prende l'aereo, torna in Italia, perch\\u00e9 succede che Conte, Grillo e pezzi dei 5 Stelle si rinfacciano reciprocamente il fatto di essere totalmente inadeguati. E se lo dicono loro noi naturalmente ci crediamo.  Se non bastasse, alla Camera il Partito Democratico pianta le proprie bandierine ideologiche, sapendo di non avere alcuna possibilit\\u00e0 di far approvare lo ius scholae o la legge sulla liberalizzazione della droga, con il solo e unico scopo di irritare e di provocare gli alleati del centrodestra. Di fronte a questo, a quello che \\u00e8 avvenuto e sta avvenendo, noi abbiamo atteso per settimane, Presidente, colleghi, che qualcuno dalle parti del Governo si alzasse e dicesse o gridasse: \\u00abGuardate ragazzi miei, la ricreazione \\u00e8 finita!\\u00bb. Ma nessuno si \\u00e8 alzato a dire questo, Presidente. Sembra che il Governo sia un Titanic, che va verso lo scoglio mentre l'orchestrina suona sempre pi\\u00f9 forte ed \\u00e8 sempre pi\\u00f9 affollato. Il Governo sedicente \\\"dei migliori\\\" si \\u00e8 presentato al giudizio dell'opinione pubblica e del Parlamento dicendo che sarebbe stato il Governo che avrebbe garantito le riforme, le cose importanti, la lotta contro le emergenze, la stabilit\\u00e0; ma il risultato che voi oggi portate qui \\u00e8 esattamente il fallimento su tutti questi fronti. Voi oggi ci consegnate il bilancio fallimentare della vostra azione di Governo. Domando a coloro che hanno chiesto, anche in queste ore, se il Governo debba continuare la sua azione anche dopo: voi affidereste il governo dell'Italia in autunno a una maggioranza che cade perch\\u00e9 non \\u00e8 in grado di approvare la realizzazione di un termovalorizzatore in provincia di Roma?  Se non siete in grado di approvare questo, quali riforme potete approvare in autunno? Quale guerra alle emergenze potete fare, se non siete in grado di fare neanche l'abc della politica? Questo succede perch\\u00e9 non esistono governi tecnici, non esistono governi istituzionali; esistono soltanto governi politici. Questo \\u00e8 un Governo politico con tutti dentro. Ma un Governo politico con tutti dentro non pu\\u00f2 che fare la fine che sta facendo: va a sbattere. \\u00c8 come guidare una macchina all'interno della quale ci sono passeggeri ognuno dei quali vuole una destinazione diversa. La fine \\u00e8 questa: o si rimane fermi o si va contro il muro. Purtroppo quello a cui assistiamo \\u00e8 esattamente lo scontrarsi del Governo contro un muro e nel far ci\\u00f2 porta insieme a s\\u00e9 anche il destino dell'Italia. Signor Presidente, io non so - ascolteremo adesso le dichiarazioni di voto finale - cosa diranno i colleghi del MoVimento 5 Stelle. So che in queste settimane hanno detto che vogliono stare nel Governo, ma anche starne fuori; che votano la fiducia, ma non la votano; che sono contro questo Esecutivo, ma i Ministri stanno ben stretti all'interno dell'Esecutivo. Vorrei dire che la situazione \\u00e8 grave ma non \\u00e8 seria. Anche rispetto a questo, noi di Fratelli d'Italia rivendichiamo la bont\\u00e0, la giustezza, il coraggio, la lungimiranza, la seriet\\u00e0 di essere rimasti unica forza di opposizione e ribadiamo ancora una volta che noi non siamo e non saremo disponibili a fare la stampella di nessun Governo, perch\\u00e9 noi vogliamo soltanto far parte di un Governo eletto dai cittadini di centrodestra.  Signor Presidente e colleghi, dispiace che non ci sia il presidente Draghi, perch\\u00e9 vorrei dirgli che noi da lui ci aspettiamo - perch\\u00e9 crediamo che sia una persona seria, al di l\\u00e0 delle differenze politiche - coerenza rispetto a quanto ha annunciato soltanto quarantotto ore fa in una conferenza stampa, quando ha detto che non c'\\u00e8 e non ci sar\\u00e0 un altro Governo Draghi, successivo a questo, senza l'attuale maggioranza. Aggiungo che solo chi teme o chi disprezza la democrazia ha paura del giorno delle elezioni. Questa maggioranza, colleghi, \\u00e8 finita ed \\u00e8 finito anche questo Governo. Diamo la parola agli italiani con il voto, lasciamo finalmente che siano loro a decidere da chi essere governati. \",\n          \"TORRISI (AP (NCD-UDC)). Signora presidente, com'\\u00e8 stato gi\\u00e0 sottolineato dal relatore, senatore Migliavacca, il Consiglio dei ministri, su proposta del ministro dell'interno Angelino Alfano, ha approvato un decreto-legge che fissa l' election day e stabilisce che per esso la prima domenica utile \\u00e8 il 31 maggio 2015, ci\\u00f2 per le tanto attese elezioni regionali e amministrative. Le Regioni per la quali si andr\\u00e0 alle urne sono il Veneto, la Liguria, la Toscana, le Marche, l'Umbria, la Campania e la Puglia. In totale si tratter\\u00e0 di poco pi\\u00f9 di 17 milioni di elettori interpellati al voto, un voto che forse inevitabilmente verr\\u00e0 letto in termini di tenuta degli schieramenti e delle alleanze politiche a livello nazionale, nonch\\u00e9 del peso politico dell'attuale Governo. Nella stessa giornata di maggio per l' election day si voter\\u00e0 anche per il rinnovo di Consigli comunali e sindaci di ben 1.089 Comuni. Si tratta del 13,5 per cento del totale dei Comuni italiani; tra essi vi sono 18 citt\\u00e0 capoluogo, di cui due con meno di 15.000 abitanti. Il decreto-legge n. 27 del 17 marzo 2015 introduce la possibilit\\u00e0 di celebrare le elezioni regionali (e nessuna implicazione o analogia pu\\u00f2 avere per le elezioni nazionali, cos\\u00ec come paventato in modo preoccupato dal senatore Calderoli) oltre il termine di sessanta giorni successivi alla scadenza del mandato consiliare, cos\\u00ec come previsto dalla legge di stabilit\\u00e0 per il 2015, al fine di consentire lo svolgimento delle prossime consultazioni elettorali amministrative e regionali in un'unica data, innanzitutto per la razionalizzazione della spesa pubblica. \\u00c8 dunque un provvedimento che permette di flessibilizzare l'arco temporale entro il quale si possono realizzare le condizioni per lo svolgimento delle consultazioni elettorali in forma abbinata. Lo spostamento del termine alla domenica compresa nei sei giorni successivi si rende necessario in quanto il rinnovo degli organi elettivi regionali dovrebbe avvenire entro il 27 maggio 2015. Tuttavia, in tale periodo non sarebbe possibile individuare una data di votazione idonea, data la coincidenza con alcune festivit\\u00e0 religiose e civili o con altre ricorrenze rilevanti ai fini dell'affluenza al voto. Pertanto, appare condivisibile la proposta del Governo di individuare il 31 maggio come data idonea per l' election day, nonostante la vicinanza della festivit\\u00e0 del 2 giugno. Infatti, un'ulteriore posticipazione comporterebbe lo svolgimento del secondo turno delle elezioni amministrative nella seconda met\\u00e0 del mese di giugno, con possibili conseguenze negative sulla partecipazione degli elettori. L'intervento, che si rende necessario ed urgente al fine di rendere effettiva la possibilit\\u00e0 di celebrare in un solo giorno le elezioni regionali ed amministrative del 2015, non solo non determina nuovi o maggiori oneri a carico della finanza pubblica, ma \\u00e8 suscettibile di produrre una riduzione complessiva delle spese elettorali in coerenza con le finalit\\u00e0 di risparmio delle disposizioni sull' election day. Il provvedimento mira dunque al duplice obiettivo della razionalizzazione della spesa pubblica e della maggiore affluenza al voto; due obiettivi che si pongono - e si devono porre - oggi al centro della riflessione delle urgenze di tutti i decisori politici. Se, infatti, da un lato, l'economia richiede misure che contengano la spesa pubblica in generale, ci\\u00f2 vale tanto di pi\\u00f9 per una spesa che pu\\u00f2 essere diminuita agevolmente, cio\\u00e8 facendo votare per le elezioni regionali e amministrative lo stesso giorno e riuscendo forse a centrare un altro obiettivo, forse anche pi\\u00f9 importante per la democrazia e per le istituzioni rappresentative e politiche, ovvero l'aumento dell'affluenza e della partecipazione al voto. \\u00c8 inutile infatti ricordare come nelle recenti elezioni vi sia stata un'astensione molto alta, una spia preoccupante per la democrazia stessa, soprattutto per quella italiana, che ha tradizionalmente registrato livelli alti, comunque buoni, di partecipazione elettorale. Basti ricordare come alle ultime elezioni politiche del 2013 vi fu un'affluenza di circa il 75 per cento degli aventi diritto, un dato buono, anche se per la prima volta nella storia dell'Italia repubblicana l'affluenza alle urne per delle elezioni politiche era scesa sotto la soglia dell'80 per cento. Non vorrei poi parlare delle ultime elezioni regionali in Emilia-Romagna, dove si \\u00e8 registrata un'affluenza alle urne bassissima, solo del 37,7 per cento, a fronte della partecipazione nelle elezioni precedenti del 2010 nella stessa Regione, dove si tocc\\u00f2 il 68 per cento circa. Il provvedimento di cui parliamo mira dunque raggiungere due obiettivi importanti: ridurre la spesa pubblica e riportare i cittadini alle urne. Inoltre - e non si tratta di un dato di poco conto - finora sembra non ci siano state importanti contestazioni e le forze politiche sono gi\\u00e0 impegnate negli adempimenti elettorali. Infatti, l' election day \\u00e8 sempre stato inviso a molti partiti politici, perch\\u00e9 solitamente si proponeva l'accorpamento di elezioni nazionali con alcune locali. Si \\u00e8 trattato, ovviamente, di elezioni che hanno cercato di seguire logiche diverse, elezioni che i partiti hanno temuto potessero influenzarsi l'un l'altra con esiti imprevedibili. Pertanto, avviandomi alla conclusione, signora Presidente e colleghi, il mio auspicio \\u00e8 che la data delle elezioni fissata al 31 maggio, con il voto favorevole sul decreto-legge in esame, non sia suscettibile a ulteriori slittamenti, perch\\u00e9 si tratterebbe solo di un'ulteriore perdita di tempo. Che questo, come stabilito dal Consiglio dei ministri, fughi da noi ogni timore per una bassa affluenza alle urne: si tratta di una paura infondata e dovuta al fatto che il 31 maggio sarebbe la domenica precedente al ponte del 2 giugno. Per i motivi da me espressi, dichiaro quindi il voto decisamente favorevole da parte del Gruppo di Area Popolare sul provvedimento in esame. \",\n          \"LA PIETRA . Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, membri del Governo, siamo oggi in questa sede a parlare della riforma dell'articolo 9 della Costituzione per introdurre un concetto importante: la tutela dell'ambiente e degli ecosistemi. Come dicevo ieri durante l'illustrazione degli emendamenti che abbiamo presentato a questo disegno di legge, Fratelli d'Italia \\u00e8 un partito patriottico, quindi un partito che ama la patria. E, quando si ama la patria, si ama la terra dei nostri padri: questo lo dico perch\\u00e9 il tema dell'ambiente \\u00e8 nel nostro DNA e lo affrontiamo sempre in maniera pragmatica. Non abbiamo bisogno di evidenziare stelle e stelline, perch\\u00e9 nel nostro obiettivo abbiamo un'unica grande stella, che \\u00e8 quella nazionale, quella dell'Italia. E, sulla base di questo, vengono declinate tutte le nostre azioni e di conseguenza anche quelle sul piano politico. Come dicevo, facciamo ambiente e abbiamo sempre fatto ambiente. Lo facciamo in maniera pragmatica e proprio con questo approccio dovremmo affrontare le modifiche che oggi vogliamo portare al disegno di legge in esame. Dico questo perch\\u00e9 molte volte, anche ascoltando gli interventi di tanti colleghi, abbiamo l'impressione che ci si voglia mettere dei gradi sulla giacchetta o una medaglietta per dire che si \\u00e8 introdotta una data modifica in Costituzione e possiamo stare tranquilli. Ci riempiamo un po' la bocca dicendo che abbiamo inserito la tutela dell'ambiente in Costituzione e tutto finisce qui. In realt\\u00e0, occorrono politiche concrete affinch\\u00e9 possano effettivamente concretizzarsi le azioni per la tutela dell'ambiente. Faccio un esempio molto banale: quando ci fermiamo ad ammirare i paesaggi della nostra Nazione, ad esempio quelli della mia terra, la Toscana, possiamo osservare colline dolci, con vigne, campi e boschi che si susseguono molte volte in maniera armonica; filari di cipressi che corrono lungo i crinali delle nostre colline. Ebbene, questa \\u00e8 tutela dell'ambiente, ma \\u00e8 una tutela dell'ambiente fatta dall'uomo. \\u00c8 l'uomo che ha creato questo ambiente: i nostri agricoltori, tutti quelli che ci hanno preceduto hanno con il loro lavoro, modificato un ambiente primordiale, e lo hanno reso quello che \\u00e8 oggi, contribuendo alla bellezza della nostra Nazione, e non solo in Toscana, ma in tutta Italia. Lo sottolineo perch\\u00e9 credo che la tutela dell'ambiente debba essere in qualche maniera concretizzata e armonizzata con le attivit\\u00e0 dell'uomo. Non possiamo avere un atteggiamento radicale, come sentiamo da certe parti di questo Parlamento. La tutela dell'ambiente da alcuni viene radicalizzata e non si dovrebbe toccare niente, n\\u00e9 fare niente. Questo non \\u00e8 il nostro atteggiamento. Se da una parte, l'introduzione della tutela ambientale, della biodiversit\\u00e0 e degli ecosistemi ci trova pienamente d'accordo, dall'altra parte abbiamo il timore che questo possa portarci a dover interpretare ogni volta quale sia la priorit\\u00e0 di applicazione. Faccio un esempio banale: c'\\u00e8 da costruire una infrastruttura per rendere pi\\u00f9 sicuro un luogo o un'infrastruttura per rendere pi\\u00f9 facile raggiungere un luogo e rendere pi\\u00f9 agevole la vita dei suoi abitanti. Facciamo questo o tuteliamo la biodiversit\\u00e0 e l'ecosistema del luogo? Spesso ci siamo trovati di fronte a situazioni del genere e per simili banalit\\u00e0, magari per proteggere alcuni beni, senza che avesse veramente senso, ci siamo trovati a interrompere importanti opere di costruzione al servizio non solo di una buona qualit\\u00e0 della vita, ma anche delle attivit\\u00e0 produttive. Un altro esempio banale: come rispondiamo se a tutela di un bene viene fatto un ricorso? Lo dico perch\\u00e9, una volta scritto, se per costruire un'infrastruttura viene fatto ricorso alla Corte costituzionale da parte di qualcuno, cosa si fa? Si blocca tutto? Si blocca la costruzione di una diga, di un depuratore, di una strada o qualsiasi altra infrastruttura di pubblica utilit\\u00e0? Attenzione. Abbiamo presentato due emendamenti al testo, entrambi recanti modifiche all'articolo 9, per eliminare o modificare la parte finale di quel comma dove si legge \\u00abLa legge dello Stato disciplina i modi e le forme di tutela degli animali\\u00bb. Noi riteniamo estremamente superfluo aver introdotto questa frase, perch\\u00e9 di fatto la tutela degli animali \\u00e8 gi\\u00e0 contemplata nel nostro ordinamento giuridico e l'Italia \\u00e8 uno dei Paesi pi\\u00f9 restrittivo da questo punto di vista. Abbiamo delle norme specifiche e nessuno ci pu\\u00f2 insegnare come deve avvenire la tutela degli animali. Apparentemente dice una cosa superflua, una banalit\\u00e0, perch\\u00e9 \\u00e8 chiaro che le leggi dello Stato declinano i principi sanciti in Costituzione. Allora perch\\u00e9 lo si \\u00e8 voluto introdurre? \\u00c8 stata una mediazione politica, ma con il rischio di far rientrare dalla finestra quello che non poteva entrare dalla porta e per questo faccio un passo indietro, signor Presidente. Prima di questa ultima ridefinizione, infatti, nel testo base proposto si leggeva: proteggere la biodiversit\\u00e0 e gli animali. Vi prego di fare attenzione, perch\\u00e9 voglio essere chiaro e non voglio che questa mia affermazione sia strumentalizzata. Ribadisco infatti in maniera chiara che noi non siamo contro la protezione degli animali, anzi; tuttavia, con il solito pragmatismo abbiamo detto di fare attenzione a scrivere certe cose in Costituzione. Avete pensato a che tipo di impatto potr\\u00e0 avere su centinaia di attivit\\u00e0 economiche? Avete pensato a cosa sarebbe potuto succedere se questa norma fosse stata scritta in questa maniera in Costituzione per i nostri allevamenti, per i nostri prodotti di eccellenza agroalimentare? \\u00c8 una domanda che mi pongo perch\\u00e9 mi sembra che questa riflessione non sia stata fatta in maniera approfondita. Banalizzo, ma con una norma scritta in questo modo, se ci fosse un ricorso alla Corte costituzionale per proteggere i suini allevati per la produzione di prosciutti o insaccati, che si fa, si smette di fare il prosciutto di Parma, tanto per citarne uno dei pi\\u00f9 conosciuti? Potrei fare altri mille esempi. Oppure si potrebbe smettere di fare i wurstel, come ci insegna la collega Unterberger  , visto che vuole comunicare a noi il modello ambientale della Germania. Non abbiamo niente da imparare da nessuno, anzi abbiamo molto da insegnare e se l'Europa ci stesse pi\\u00f9 a sentire, molto probabilmente tante cose sarebbero risolte in modo migliore. Inoltre, come in parte sta succedendo, si sarebbe interrotta l'attivit\\u00e0 venatoria: in Costituzione poteva essere scritto che la Repubblica protegge gli animali? Bisogna fare attenzione! Cos\\u00ec avremmo i cinghiali a passeggiare per le vie della Capitale, che mi sembra un caso abbastanza eclatante, o di tante altre citt\\u00e0; poi avremmo anche il caso di associazioni che potrebbero essere preposte alla cura e al mantenimento di questi animali che, ricordo a tutti noi, sono nocivi e arrecano danni all'agricoltura e all'ambiente. Insomma, si tratta di un provvedimento che lascia alcuni dubbi interpretativi abbastanza preoccupanti sul piano agricolo e non solo; un provvedimento di cui non abbiamo capito l'urgenza, la necessit\\u00e0 e che impegna l'Assemblea in un momento cos\\u00ec delicato per la Nazione, alle prese con una pandemia le cui conseguenze stanno imperversando pesantemente sulla nostra economia. Abbiamo voluto introdurre questa discussione e stiamo passando una giornata e mezza a parlare di questo. Non dico che non sia rilevante; tuttavia, in un momento in cui siamo chiamati a fare scelte importanti per il futuro della Nazione e delle prossime generazioni, invece di parlare di questo parliamo di tutela degli animali. Sicuramente \\u00e8 una battaglia di civilt\\u00e0, non dico il contrario, ma mi domando se questa era davvero una priorit\\u00e0, a meno che non si ritenga il nostro Paese arretrato sul piano della tutela dell'ambiente e dell'ecosistema, ma vi ripeto che non lo \\u00e8. Ricordo a me stesso e a tutta l'Assemblea che l'Italia, dal punto di vista ambientale e faunistico, \\u00e8 uno dei Paesi pi\\u00f9 virtuosi in Europa e nel mondo. L'impressione \\u00e8 invece che ci sia una maggioranza - lo dico in maniera molto chiara - che usa questo Governo di unit\\u00e0 nazionale, che avrebbe lo scopo di gestire e attuare il Piano nazionale di ripresa e resilienza (PNRR) - questo era il motivo per cui era nato - per portare avanti posizioni ideologiche sfruttando i delicati e precari equilibri politici di Governo: tutela degli animali, ius soli, decreto-legge sulle zone economiche speciali (ZES). Fate attenzione, amici della Lega e di Forza Italia! Ritornando al tema, non basta la forma, occorre la sostanza, come dicevo. In tema di tutela ambientale occorrono politiche di vasta scala, che ad esempio impediscano l'abbandono delle aree periferiche come la montagna che, se non curata, crea criticit\\u00e0 anche a valle. Per queste, per\\u00f2, non si fa niente. Occorrono politiche per il rinnovo dei mezzi di trasporto pubblico, ma si investe sui monopattini. Occorrono investimenti e politiche energetiche su fonti rinnovabili, ma si svende l'idroelettrico agli stranieri. La tutela ambientale si ottiene partendo da un'educazione civica nelle scuole, investendo in professionalit\\u00e0 e strutture e non con i banchi a rotelle. Insomma, signor Presidente, molta retorica, molta enfatizzazione, ma pochi fatti. Siamo favorevoli alla tutela ambientale, ma con azioni concrete. Non siamo convinti sulla forma che richiama la tutela degli animali e per questi motivi dichiaro il voto di astensione del Gruppo Fratelli d'Italia. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
